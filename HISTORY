#Change History#

####V1.1####
April 4, 2014 - psCloudstack V1.1 was presented to a group of enthusiastic colleagues. As a result this version is now published on GitHub.com
There are still a couple of ToDo items and they will be taken care of in good time (or sooner if possible/required)

####V1.2####
April 9, 2014 - Connect-CSManager (the base function which builds all the api functions) had a shortcoming, all api function parameters were handled as strings. 
This is no problem for the actual api call since that's string oriented anyway (web request url). What might be considered a problem is the PowerShell parameter 
handling of the api functions, everything got handled as if it were a string, even integers, booleans, etc.  
Connect-CSManager now creates a better (formatted) list of api function parameters, including mandatory and type settings. The following 'translation' 
table is used to convert the 'Unix types' to 'PowerShell types'

         | --------- | -------- |     | --------- | -------- |
         | Unix type | PS type  |     | Unix type | PS type  |
         | --------- | -------- |     | --------- | -------- |
         | boolean   | switch   |     | map       | string   |
         | date      | string   |     | short     | int16    |
         | integer   | int32    |     | string    | string   |
         | list      | string[] |     | uuid      | string   |
         | long      | int64    |     | tzdate    | string   |
         | --------- | -------- |     | --------- | -------- |

In psCloudstack the Cloudstack api boolean is replaced by a PowerShell switch parameter which takes no value at all.
This means that; false is not specified and true when specified

A welcome message has been added to Connect-CSManager, if you find it annoying use -Silent to suppress it.

####V2.0####
April 14, 2014 - A rather intense update. Removed a lot of ugly code and improved sync/async code streams.
Most important change: asynch functions now support -Wait/-NoWait
- In V1.2 the Cloudstack api boolean was replaced by a PowerShell switch parameter. Some thought this to be a setback.  
  Created the possibility of using Unix style booleans again by introducing -CommandStyle [Unix|Windows] for Connect-CSManager  
  This option can also be set via the config file, in the <connect> section the line <command style="xxxxxx" /> has been added  
- Asynchronous functions now support -Wait xxx and -NoWait (mutually exclusive!) By default when a asynchronous function is called  
  the function will wait until the action is completed, and when completed it will show job details.  
  -Wait xxx the number of seconds to wait can specified, a warning will be issued when the job has not completed within this time.  
  -NoWait will return the job details immediately.
- The embedded help details have been improved. Mixed usage of Input and parameter specifications were disturbing
- Function code for synchronous and asynchronous functions have been separated. The function now only contains the code stream  
  it requires.
- Removed some old 'debug-like' lines of code.

####V2.0.1####
Some small bugfixes;
- Initialize-CSConfig now works like documented
- Get-CSConfig does not do a implied Set-CSConfig anymore
- Hide Invoke-WebRequest progressbar
- Removed version warning, update config instead using internal Update-ApiInfo function



Kind Regards,
