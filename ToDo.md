#To Do List#

There are still a few things to do about psCloudstack. My current list is:

 - Implement -Wait/-NoWait for async calls. Part of the code is already there, the logic still need to find its way
 
 - The current release uses string parameters only, this means for example that ‘boolean’ parameters must have a value assigned (true or false). A future release will convert a PowerShell switch parameter to the api call related name/value pair.


 Please send me your wishes and lets see whether they can be implemented.
